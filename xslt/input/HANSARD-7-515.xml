Dr McGowan should be commended for the initiatives that he and his team are putting in place to eliminate ramping, and in my view actions speak louder than words.</text>

Minister, same budget line: previously, on 30 April, Mr Paul Lambert, the executive director of operations at CALHN said on ABC radio, and I quote, 'Ramping over the last 100 days has decreased…it’s a significant number of hours decreased.' If that is the case, why does the SA Ambulance data show that ramping has increased over that period and in fact is at record highs now of over 2,000 hours per month in both May and June?</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  The situation that we have experienced since this government came to power has been extremely unusual. Obviously, we were encountering the first year without the Repatriation General Hospital. In the first year of operation of the new Royal Adelaide Hospital we experienced a heavy winter last year and quite exceptional summer demand. It is obviously also noteworthy that there has been an unprecedented early and heavy flu season.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000049">The health system has had a lot to cope with in the last 12 months. I consider that real progress is being made on dealing with the underlying demand. Ambulance ramping did see a reduction as we went into winter, but, as I said, we have experienced a very heavy flu season. In this context, it is pleasing to see that in recent weeks we have had some of our best weeks of the year in terms of transfer of care. I also note that emergency department wait times for mental health patients are the best they have been for eight months.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for his question. The house would be well aware that Labor broke its promise to 'never, ever close the Repat', and in doing so cut off more than 100 beds from the health system. This has directly contributed to the pressure the health system faces today, and this government is determined to fix Labor's mess.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000063">The government made a clear commitment to reactivate the Repat site as a genuine health precinct and to work with the community in doing so. As minister, one of my early actions was to stop Labor's sale of the site and to secure it for public health services going forward. We reopened the hydrotherapy pool and began the community engagement process we had promised. We have engaged the community, clinicians, veterans and other key stakeholders to determine the best use of this valuable and much-loved community asset.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000064">The final concept master plan of the Repat site, developed on the results of public and stakeholder feedback, has received strong community endorsement, and we have also continued this government's strong record in working collaboratively with our federal colleagues, securing a joint investment of $80 million in the Repat health precinct. I would now ask the executive director for infrastructure to provide some updates on recent activity on the Repat site.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Mr WOOLCOCK:</by>  Since March 2018, the government has successfully reopened the hydrotherapy pool and opened a further 20 new beds to add capacity to our health system and accommodate long stay patients with complex needs, some of whom have been waiting for up to six months in hospital for commonwealth supports. It has also retained 20 beds within the ViTA precinct, due for closure in December 2018.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000066">SA Health is continuing to progress discussions with key stakeholders to deliver the master plan. The first stage of Repat reactivation building works are expected to commence later this year with the refurbishment of C Block.

In that context the Repat site is becoming analogous to the Glenside site in that it will be hosting services provided by more than one LHN. In the context of the Glenside site, there needed to be discussions between local health networks about how do they govern a site that is not exclusively in their control. Without having access to those papers, I presume it is referring to similar discussions in the Repat context.</text>

I presume the SALHN discussion is a discussion that feeds into broader discussions within the portfolio. The discussions that SALHN is having through their board, and I am sure through their management, will feed into a broader discussion. As I said, unlike when Labor closed the Repat, the Repat will no longer be only the custodian of SALHN assets, it will also be sharing the site with other networks.</text>

On 11 March 2019, SA Health released a request for information seeking insights on how interested developers, private health service providers and local health networks could collaborate with SA Health in the provision of facilities and services relating to the surgical and procedural services within the reactivated Repat site.</text>

I might seek some more information. As I was saying, the former Labor government closed the Oakden facility in late 2017. I think there was a net loss of 64 beds, or something in that order, with the closure of that facility.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000083">The recurrent funding that is associated with those beds would transfer. Likewise, we are committing the transfer of the brain and spinal services that are currently at Hampstead and their recurrent funding will come with them. As each piece in the Repat health precinct falls into place, the capital funding and the recurrent funding will be part of that process.</text>

Consistent with that, the government is working with the Ambulance Service to look at the new operational model for SA Ambulance Service, and I certainly appreciate that my honourable colleague the Treasurer is also discussing operational issues with the Ambulance Employees Association in the context of enterprise bargaining discussions. Right throughout the Ambulance Service, its employee organisations and the department, there is an interest in developing new ways of delivering paramedic services. There is no doubt that paramedics going forward are going to be a very agile and key element of our health service.</text>

I appreciate the opportunity to explain the work of the Hospital Discharge Project pilot which commenced on 1 April 2019 and which will be running for a period of six months. A commitment between SA Health and the commonwealth Department of Health in March 2019 facilitated an $8 million project to deal with the long-stay transition to discharge project to assist in transferring long-stay patients in acute beds to alternative non-acute care options while longer term supports are confirmed. This may include some NDIS-eligible patients who are awaiting NDIS confirmations.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000137">To date, 53 patients have been discharged from hospital, with a further three patients due to be discharged by early 2019. SA Health and local health networks have identified a further 35 long-stay patients for this project with the aim to discharge by October 2019. Of the 35, 12 patients are currently being considered by providers to determine their discharge support needs. The project is funded for two years and will improve patient flow from hospitals to communities. I will ask the Chief Executive of Wellbeing SA, Lyn Dean, to add to that.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Ms DEAN:</by>  Thank you, minister. The SA Hospital Discharge Project is a collaboration with the National Disability Insurance Scheme to streamline discharge processes within our hospital system. To date, the project has resulted in some key improvements, including the appointment of three health liaison officers from the National Disability Insurance Agency, and agreeing to trial improvement in equipment and home modification assessment processes, with hospital occupational therapists, to assist more timely discharges. A data tool to track NDIS participants' progress through the hospital to community is also in development.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000139">Alongside this, there is a hospital discharge framework, which is, in effect, developing policies and principles that are drafted with South Australia to guide how Health and NDIS will work together to discharge patients. This framework will be taken forward on a national level once it is fully implemented.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000140">In addition to that, recent interjurisdictional discussions have taken place in resolving boundary issues between the NDIS and the health system. From an historical perspective, there has been disagreement from the NDIA and Health as to what would be funded in regard to nursing supports. It is recognised by the NDIS that some people will need nursing support to be discharged and cared for in the community, and now this will be funded by NDIS. The aim is to implement this change from October of this year.</text>

In terms of the work that I have already referred to there is work being done for a new operational model for the Ambulance Service. In recent years, there has been a fundamental shift in the services provided by SAAS and the use of those services by the community.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000170">The historical model of ambulance officers providing first aid and transporting patients into a hospital ED has evolved into an increasingly sophisticated out-of-hospital healthcare provider model. The Ambulance Service is keen to implement a new operational model that will assist local health networks to manage patient flow by reducing ED presentations and support the management of patients outside the hospital environment in line with proposed health alternative care pathways.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000171">The introduction of a revised clinical response model which utilises an increased use of single responders to create a more targeted see-and-treat model where complex patients can be assessed and treated, referred to alternative care pathways or transport by lower clinical-level crews are all matters under consideration. The Ambulance Service has evolved dramatically over its history, but particularly over recent decades. I am sure that it will continue to evolve.

I think that is the trouble in part because anyone facing this situation needs to be in a respectful and understanding setting and not moved from site to site having to repeat the story several times for people who have not read the notes.

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for his question, and I particularly appreciate why he is asking it. The honourable member and his colleague the honourable member for King are acutely aware of the damage done to their communities by Transforming Health. The damage was particularly felt at Modbury, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital and at Noarlunga where services were downgraded or, in some cases, shut down completely. Of course, we know from the Auditor-General's report on Transforming Health that this reduction in services came at a cost to the taxpayer of $47 million.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000221">The Marshall Liberal government has committed to rebuilding services at these hospitals. In the first year, we have made tangible progress. We have opened a 12-bed acute care unit at Noarlunga, we have begun the work on the TQEH stage 3 redevelopment, as well as returned 24/7 cardiac services and established a clinical working group to ensure the safe return of an HDU to Modbury. This year's budget is building on the work of the first year at Modbury where the government has committed $96 million for the redevelopment and $18 million over four years to establish an HDU.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000222">An amount of $32 million has been committed in this year's budget, continuing work towards the HDU opening at TQEH where I recently delivered on another of the government's election commitments and opened the refurbished cath labs; $63 million of the stage 3 redevelopment has been allocated to continue the work there. At Noarlunga, the 12-bed acute medical unit has opened with funding allocated to support its ongoing operation to provide better care at the hospital and ease the pressure on Flinders Medical Centre, particularly reducing the need for diversion.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000223">The Marshall Liberal government is delivering on its commitments, and this budget demonstrates that we are putting in the funding necessary to clean up the mess left by the former Labor government.</text>

            <by role="member" id="4841">Mr PICTON:</by>  I refer to the same budget line in Budget Paper 4, Volume 3, page 26, CALHN. Is the minister aware that the acquisition plan for the KordaMentha original contract says that KordaMentha provided CALHN with feedback similar to other recruitment companies; however, they suggested a model which would meet CALHN's needs and allow for the capabilities relating to turnaround in CALHN to be built up over this time? This model was based on a short-term consultancy. So is it not the case that KordaMentha were asked to hire somebody, they did not do that, they said they could not find somebody and recommended that they themselves be hired as a consultancy to do the work?</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  A very pertinent question, because in spite of the resistance of the former government members to the attempts by this government to clear up their mess, progress is being made. The financial position of CALHN, in partnership with KordaMentha, has improved from a forecast deficit to budget of $274 million for the year ended 2019, as outlined in the diagnostic, to a revised management forecast deficit to budget of $224 million. This is a forecast improvement of $50 million and well ahead of the KordaMentha contractual KPI of $41 million.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000244">Honourable members would be well aware of the government's concern at the relative inefficiency of the Central Adelaide Local Health Network hospitals compared with their sister hospitals right around Australia. In the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018, the estimated cost of running the central hospitals was 32 per cent above the national efficient price. Encouragingly, there has been substantial progress in dealing with inefficiencies. The indicative cost of activity for the six months to 31 December 2018 is 21 per cent above the national efficient price.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000245">One of the most tangible demonstrations of efficiencies in our central hospitals is the reduced use of agency staff. It is now down 90 per cent, from 7.7 per cent in January 2019 to a low of 0.7 per cent in March 2019. In this and so many other ways, KordaMentha, the CALHN management and the CALHN board are working together to restore sustainability to the services in the local health network.</text>

A unit was opened in 2018, last year, and planning is going ahead with the new unit.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000258">The whole project has been damaged by the lack of proper planning by the former Labor government. There was not adequate allowance for the car parking needs. The new redevelopment effectively decommissions a whole series of car parks, so the $7 million investment that was announced this week will lead to a 205 car park extension to the current facility, which will help alleviate the loss of the previous car parks and add to the further needs.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000259">In terms of the Mental Health Short Stay Unit, the long-term location for that unit is on top of the ED redevelopment. It is an upper level development. We will continue to work through with clinicians and with management how we can best deliver that project. Certainly, we are being forced to reassess the plans and reassess the funding of those plans because of the poor planning of the former government.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  Planning in relation to the project continues. The government is committed to completing the expansion of the ED and the short stay mental health unit. Considering the poor planning that we have inherited, we may need to reconsider some of the final refurbishment works of the original facilities. The expanded redevelopment will deliver important expanded capacity for the suburbs of the north.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for his question. The Marshall Liberal government was elected with a commitment to devolve governance and responsibility in the health system away from a centralised bureaucracy to local health networks. The whole raison d'être is: local decisions for local communities.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000306">The former Labor government abolished local boards in 2008, centralising decision-making. As part of their disastrous Transforming Health experiment, Labor continued this centralising trend with the abolition of statewide clinical networks, shutting out clinicians and the community with ever-growing centralisation of decision-making. The end result was that the South Australian community lost touch and lost faith in Labor's ability to deliver health services.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000307">The Marshall Liberal government is determined to turn the ship around. To support the devolution of governance and the refocusing of health, my department has been undergoing a restructure to reflect its place in a changed health system and its place in a devolved, decentralised health system. I will ask the chief executive of the department to give the committee more information about the process of renewal of his department.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Dr McGOWAN:</by>  As the minister said, after the devolution out to the regions, we thought it was opportune to look at the department. It was left a very different department wanting to do different things. We are no longer a deliverer of service and a micromanager of services. We had to be very clear about what our role was going forward, so we engaged quite heavily. We engaged with our staff and we also engaged some of the best bureaucratic minds in health from across the country, previous DGs who are highly respected and who gave their time freely, by the way, with some excitement.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000309">We came up with four core roles. They have turned into the pillars of the department and we have structured accordingly. They are to make sure that, as the government came in and made its policy about a focus on prevention, the public health role was elevated to be reporting to the chief executive—a critical part of a very preventative focus—and that division is called the division of health regulation and protection.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000310">The second division is, if you are stepping away from being the provider and direct manager of services and becoming a commissioner of services, we wanted to be excellent at commissioning and design and bring all the functions of commissioning into one division where they could focus on that, and so we have created the commissioning and performance—so commission, performance, monitor, support and plan.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000311">If there is one role the department needs to do and has not really done to its degree in the past, it is to be the steward of the health system in respect of knowing how the health system is unfolding, where is the national agreement going, what is happening with private health insurance, what is happening with genetics and epigenetics and how we position the department for the next decade or two. That long-term view of the stewardship of the department is very important, so we created the system leadership and design. Then, of course, the department itself needs to be managed as a corporate function.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000312">We also, at the minister's instigation, created two new fundamental pillars, attached offices, that of Wellbeing SA to make sure that we do not go through the abandonment of our primary care, and to have a strong, dedicated focus on prevention and hospital substitution. That is beginning to materialise now.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000313">The second key issue was to make sure that, in this devolved region, the clinicians had a mechanism by which they could cross the regions and still connect around clinical domains such as cardiology, respiratory, or whatever. So we have created the Commission on Excellence and Innovation in Health, which will not only provide the mechanisms to re-establish clinical networks and capitalise on the research and opportunities which are coming with continuous development but also will make sure the regions are quite harmonised across the regions. The commission is also focusing on the opportunities that come with digital health.</text>

          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000314">A couple of other things we have done in this structure are that we have essentially made sure that the critical role of the Chief Psychiatrist and director of mental health services reports directly to the chief executive so that the fundamental importance of mental health is recognised. I would put it to you that there is probably not much redefining society today more than technology, yet technology was buried down in the organisation, so we have elevated the head of digital health to be a direct report to the chief executive as well. That, I hope, creates a department that is well positioned to deliver the health services we need in the future in line with the government's priorities.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  The Marshall Liberal team in opposition was very concerned about the lack of sensitivity of the former Labor government, particularly to long-stay patients. You saw that most starkly at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, where weekly car parking fees at the RAH had been $65 per week. For people making regular lengthy visits to family or friends or for patients who needed to make repeated visits, that was a real impost.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000335">The government, on its election, undertook a review. One of the things that this review highlighted was that exemptions did not apply at the Women's and Children's Hospital. As a result of the review that was undertaken, the Women's and Children's Hospital has commenced to implement car parking exemptions for eligible consumers. Also, the government reduced the weekly car park fees at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, the weekly pass, to that comparable with other hospitals.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000336">Consistent with our concern for long-stay repeat patients and people who are visiting them, existing exemption arrangements at all metropolitan hospitals have been broadened to include not only patients but also parents or carers of a baby or a young child patient. Patients or parents or carers of a baby or a young child patient who are required to attend the hospital for clinical reasons at least once a week for a period of at least four weeks are eligible for exemption. This includes patients in palliative care, paraplegic, quadriplegic, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and renal patients.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000337">Other patients, relatives or carers may be eligible for car parking exemptions, subject to the approval of the Health facility manager (or delegate). Volunteers approved by the health facility manager are also exempt. These are important expansions of exemptions to make car parking more affordable to those on whom it falls most heavily.</text>

Staff car parking fees have been aligned more closely with the cost of public transport. The government needs to continue to raise revenue to invest in car parking facilities.

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I certainly will. The Marshall Liberal government is committed to providing South Australians with care closer to home and to provide more support for people to stay well and out of hospital. Earlier this year, we launched three innovative home hospital pilot programs in the northern, southern and central local health networks.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000352">These three pilot programs have helped free up hundreds of hospital bed days by providing home or community care to a total of 660 patients. The programs have prevented dozens of presentations to emergency departments and hospital admissions, providing much-needed relief for our busy hospital staff and busy EDs. The pilots have shown that receiving care at home or in the community is embraced by patients and delivers high-quality sustainable care.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000353">For older patients, a hospital stay often worsens their overall condition. It may disrupt their routine and sleep, reduce access to family and friends and involve prolonged bed rest, which can rapidly decrease muscle strength. Receiving care in a familiar and comfortable surrounding benefits a patient's wellbeing.</text>

In order to create a more sustainable health system, we need to move towards a system that provides safe, high quality but lower cost alternatives to hospital care. I would ask the CEO to give us advice on the progress of the pilot projects.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Dr McGOWAN:</by>  I thank the minister. There are three major projects we are running, which are quite exciting. In the north we have a program run by a group called Pop-Up, and it has essentially found the frequent flyers or frequent presenters to the emergency department. These are often people with very complex needs and they often have not had a general practitioner to support them. Essentially, they work with those people to connect them with a general practitioner and to provide them with the support they need.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000356">So far they have 216 patients enrolled, 153 actively today; 63 of those patients have been discharged, but there is a lot of evidence to indicate that maybe up to 45 presentations a day might be avoided by that service alone. We are continuing to do an evaluation of all of these, but particularly of that one to validate that. But it seems like a pretty important role in helping people keep away from the hospital and getting the primary and preventative care they need.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000357">In the south, RDNS is working with the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network to again connect with people who have either been in hospital too long and cannot get out without support, or get people from the emergency department straight into the community. As of Wednesday, 434 patients had received care under that pilot, most of them aged over 65; 230 of those referrals having come straight from the emergency department, so you can pretty much assume that those people are saved admissions; and 204 referrals from the inpatient unit, again indicating that they probably got out earlier. With these programs, 85 per cent of them have indicated that they prefer to get that care than be admitted to hospital. It is saving pressure on our hospitals and giving people better care.</text>

There are arrangements such that security guards can accompany staff when needed.

The government is delighted to be improving the services at the Mount Barker District Soldiers' Memorial Hospital with the installation of three haemodialysis chairs.

          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000379">I was delighted that the honourable member was able to join me in visiting the hospital recently. The community is excited that local patients receiving dialysis treatment in the Hills area will be able to get that at Mount Barker, rather than needing to travel to Murray Bridge or Adelaide. Up to 12 patients each week will be able to receive the treatment in the dual-purpose chemotherapy and haemodialysis unit. The unit will be delivered with an $800,000 investment. We know that treatment for kidney failure is a stressful time for patients and this new service removes the added pressure for treatment and enables them to receive their care closer to home.</text>

Mount Barker is the third largest birthing hospital in country South Australia, with more than 500 births annually.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for his question. The Marshall Liberal government has funded the establishment of a fixated threat assessment centre to mitigate mass casualty terrorism events by lone actors and others, mass casualty events in schools and assassination attempts on dignitaries. Whilst these are low likelihood events, they can be catastrophic events.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000447">The South Australian fixated threat assessment centre will provide a coordinated evidence-based approach, using agreed assessment tools and the input of forensic psychologists, forensic psychiatrists and specialist mental health nurses to support sworn police officers.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000448">The initial focus will include the following groups: firstly, persons fixated with undertaking terrorist acts but without that threat being linked to an underlying ideology; youths fixated with undertaking mass casualty attacks on schools; and persons who may pose a fixated threat to South Australian dignitaries. Considering the Chief Psychiatrist's involvement in this work, I will ask Dr Brayley whether he had any thoughts to add.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Dr BRAYLEY:</by>  The minister has referred to the professional composition of the team: the half-time forensic psychiatrist, there is a full-time forensic psychologist, and two specialist mental health nurses. The funding also supports an analyst for SAPOL. Given the significance of the initiative, the decision was to establish a centre rather than a panel. Originally, we were going to have a virtual panel but it has become a centre. The most recent planning discussions have had the centre to be located with sworn officers from the state protective security branch within SAPOL, so it would be based with them.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000450">Back on 16 July, the Department of the Premier and Cabinet organised a fixated threat assessment capability round table with representatives from WA, Northern Territory, ACT and Tasmania, and they heard work that Victoria was presenting, because Victoria has had a leadership role in this area. The budget for this in 2019-20 is $602,000.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  The honourable member's question is based on a misnomer. First of all, Wellbeing SA is not part of the department. Over the next year, it will be an attached unit. The Mental Health Commission is also an attached unit. I want to make it clear that the reorganisation of mental health services, as a result of the governance review earlier this year, will see no diminution of investment in mental health. The government commissioned a mental health governance review by Aspex Consulting, from which the government prepared an interim government response.</text>

          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000453">The review and the response went out for community consultation and there was significant feedback in relation to the proposals in relation to the Mental Health Commission. It would be fair to say that the primary concern was about the engagement of lived experience. In terms of the health promotion and preventive elements, it makes eminent sense that Wellbeing SA, which is a whole-of-person prevention and primary health agency, was a logical location for mental health prevention and primary care, and that, as proposed by the review, it made sense for those services to be delivered in concert with Wellbeing SA.</text>

          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000457">In response to community consultation, the government's final response amended our response to recommendation 5. It saw the health and preventive elements going to Wellbeing SA and the lived-experience element being strengthened in a Mental Health Commission that will be expanded. It will now include three commissioners—a full commissioner and two part-time commissioners—and there will be an open call for positions. People with lived experience of mental health, as either a consumer of services or a carer, will be encouraged to apply.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000458">Primarily, the resources that are currently budgeted to go to the Mental Health Commission will be primarily allocated between the Mental Health Commission and Wellbeing SA. There may well be some resources that are transferred to the Office of the Chief Psychiatrist, but, as I said, the resources will continue to be dedicated to mental health. The final budget allocations between those three agencies will become clear, particularly as the future shape of the Mental Health Commission and the future shape of Wellbeing SA are clarified in the months ahead.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  There were certainly concerns about the consultation method, but there are a lot of opinions about consultations. I find a lot of people are frustrated about consultations that lack a focus. One thing that can be clear from this consultation is, by having a mental health governance review report and the draft interim response, the community was able to clearly express its views because it had a clear proposal to respond to.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000487">I believe the fact that the government engaged the community, listened to the community and responded to the community means that we will have a better, more robust mental health governance framework going forward.</text>

The fact of the matter is that lots of people in SA Health have lots of different roles. SA Health and, for that matter, other members of the department and the wider portfolio were engaged in the consultation. I believe that it was a robust consultation. The fact that the government substantially reformed its position demonstrates that it was a successful consultation.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for his question. The department, and particularly the Office of the Chief Psychiatrist, monitor such indicators. I must say that it is very pleasing to see that the latest rate for the proportion of mental health patients who were waiting longer than 24 hours has fallen. In June, it was 8.5 per cent, which is in fact the lowest rate in eight months. That is particularly pleasing considering the high demand that we have been experiencing through summer and with the large flu season.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000510">We are determined to continue to see improvement in that important area of timely delivery of care. In that context, we are hopeful and optimistic that the opening of the 10 forensic mental health beds at Glenside will help to continue that positive trend. I am sure that part of the positive trend is related to the work of the court diversion service strategy. Considering his key role in rolling that out, I ask the Chief Psychiatrist to explain how the court diversion service strategy has helped improve the reduction in the number of mental health patients staying for more than 24 hours.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Dr BRAYLEY:</by>  Certainly, minister. Regarding the court diversion strategy, the concern had been the number of forensic outlier patients in community beds. The community bed number is modelled on the needs of the community. Back in February of this year, we were up to 15 forensic patients who were either in an ED or in an acute community unit. The forensic court diversion began in March and since then, through to June, the figure dropped to 7.8 forensic outlier patients. This reflects the number of orders that are avoided when people are assessed and referred to mental health teams and information is given to the court.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000512">This reduction is important because 10 new forensic beds were opened with the aim of addressing this overflow of people who are forensic patients into the community beds. If it was not for the initial reduction calls by the court diversion service, we would not have had enough capacity with our 10 beds to be effective. In the last week, there have been four forensic overflow patients in community beds.</text>

Honourable members will recall that there were two significant reports into older persons mental health services in response to Oakden. One was by the Chief Psychiatrist and one was by the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption. The South Australian government is implementing a number of measures to protect our most vulnerable people. We are reforming the state's mental health services for older people and making improvements to governance, monitoring, infrastructure, safety and quality and the mental health workforce.</text>

Primarily, we are doing it through the changes to the Independent Commissioner Against Corruption legislation. The state government accepted all six of the Chief Psychiatrist's recommendations and all 13 of the commissioner's recommendations, and SA Health has taken on oversight of the implementation of the recommendations. I will ask the Chief Psychiatrist whether he might elaborate on that.</text>

In terms of the initial recommendations coming out of former chief psychiatrist Aaron Groves' report, that of course is leading to the older persons mental health reform currently underway. We have work underway for the 18-bed tier 7 dementia unit at the Repat site. There is a committee that I am chairing that is developing the model of care for that new facility.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000524">It will also consider how it interfaces with other specialist dementia care units for people with tier 5 and 6 dementia and issues of staffing, culture and standards of care. That work is currently underway. We also have a rollout of rapid access teams, psychogeriatric teams that will go into residential aged-care facilities to provide assessment, advice and support. That is basically starting in 2019-20.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000525">In terms of commissioner Lander's ICAC report, a preliminary response was published in March of this year and we are about to present a completed report to the minister. This work will address governance roles, responsibilities and local health network training for SLS. Already there has been an increase in the number and frequency of Chief Psychiatrist inspections and a particular focus on unannounced inspections.</text>

Mr Julian Gardner from Victoria, the inaugural public advocate from Victoria, was asked to do that work, as well as looking at our functions and resources and assets generally, amongst other recommendations that were in the ICAC report. There is a range of specific actions involving our systems generally but also particularly the Office of the Chief Psychiatrist and the Community Visitor Scheme.</text>

I was referring to the final report following the Chief Psychiatrist's response report which he mentioned earlier this year. He said that he was due to give it to the chief executive soon but that previously it was promised before 30 June. The preliminary report from the Chief Psychiatrist also talked about a restrictive practice review which would be completed in early 2019, with an updated policy published in June, and that appears to not have occurred either.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for his question. It highlights the importance of tackling forensic mental health as a particular cohort. As the Chief Psychiatrist mentioned in his earlier remarks, there was a significant increase in forensic mental health patients that was having a knock-on effect, if you like, on the broader health system. It was impacting on length of stay for other mental health consumers, and it was adding to the stress on emergency departments.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000565">The honourable member's question highlights the importance of the changes to actually deliver appropriate mental health care to people with forensic mental health issues. The commissioning of the 10-bed secure inpatient forensic unit at Glenside, of course, will increase capacity but, very importantly, it will give us an opportunity to have a much better flow between the emergency departments and the other parts of the forensic mental health network.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000566">The 10 forensic and Department for Correctional Services subacute rehabilitation patients have now moved from James Nash House into that 10-bed unit. Prior to opening the unit, minor capital works were completed and the Chief Psychiatrist's office inspected and approved the facility. I might ask the Chief Psychiatrist, who I know would do a much better job of explaining it to the committee, how the forensic mental healthcare pathway is improved by adding the Glenside campus facility.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Dr BRAYLEY:</by>  Currently, in South Australia, the forensic bed capacity is 70 beds, with 50 inpatient beds at James Nash House, the 10 inpatient beds at Glenside Hospital which have just been opened which will cost $4.9 million this year to operate—$20.35 million has been allocated over four years for their operation—and 10 residential step-down beds at Ashton House.</text>
          <page num="254" />
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000568">It has been a particular benefit because our Forensic Mental Health Service also caters for people who have a forensic disability, people with intellectual disability, brain injury and other disabilities that might have led to offending where people have been found not guilty by reason of mental impairment or unfit to plead. They are looked after in a unit called the Tarnanthi unit. Eight of the beds of these 10 beds bring together the forensic disability client cohort.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000569">This then frees up beds at James Nash House for acute admissions which may be prisoners who have a mental illness or other forensic patients who need acute care. These people might otherwise have been going to emergency departments or into other wards. We have seen a link between the forensic outlier numbers and waits in emergency departments, so this is good for the patient group who are now at Glenside, with a particular focus on forensic disability. It creates more beds for forensic patients and has benefits for the community as well.</text>

The honourable member for Kavel might help me. It is a concurrent delegation. In other words, minister Lensink has the functions and powers pursuant to the Health Care Act 2008 and the Mental Health Act 2009 with respect to eating disorder services but I continue to have those powers, too.</text>

The Marshall Liberal team went to the election with that commitment. A report on the governance of the services was commissioned by the chief executive of SA Health.

As the paediatric eating disorder service issue was considered, I decided that it was appropriate to make the delegation because I thought that that report raised an issue of conflict of interest in relation to me making the decision because of my wife's involvement in eating disorder services.</text>

In relation to eating disorders, if I think that that raises issues of conflict of interest—as I said, I retain powers in relation to eating disorder services.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000588">If I could give the honourable members a suggestion on that, the Chair quite rightly asked the question, 'Where does the money for eating disorder services go?' In relation to the Statewide Eating Disorder Service, that is a statewide service that is hosted by the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network. Therefore, the standard funding allocation to the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network, some of that will go to fund the Statewide Eating Disorder Service. In my view, there are issues in relation to eating disorders that will not represent a conflict of interest. In this context I formed the view that there was an issue in relation to paediatric eating disorder services, so that is why a delegation has been made.</text>

The government sees the plan as an important part of rebuilding our mental health services in South Australia. The plan responds to a seven-year hiatus in planning for the mental health system since the Stepping Up report, 2007-2012. That report effectively expired some seven years ago.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000593">The Mental Health Commissioner and the Chief Psychiatrist worked together with extensive community consultation. Of course, that built on the Mental Health Strategic Plan 2017–2022. The report itself has been given to the government, and we are working through it. I intend to take it to cabinet in the not-too-distant future.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for his question. The Borderline Personality Disorder Collaborative is a new service that is implementing a statewide model of stepped care in partnership with all local health networks. It is responding to a significant service gap in relation to people with borderline personality disorders. It commenced operations on 1 July 2019, and I was pleased to officially launch the BPD Co hub on 7 June at 100 Greenhill Road, Unley. I acknowledge the fact that the shadow minister for health and wellbeing also joined me for that event.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000630">The Barossa Hills Fleurieu Local Health Network is hosting and leading the development of a statewide borderline personality disorder centre of excellence, which will be called the Borderline Personality Disorder Collaborative, or BPD Co for short. I am very pleased that this initiative is finally underway after years of lobbying by consumers and carers.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000631">People with BPD often find themselves misunderstood and marginalised by the broader health system and within EDs more broadly, and funding this service will go some way towards supporting up to 68,000 South Australians living with BPD and their family carers. I wonder if the Chief Psychiatrist might want to add anything on that service?</text>

            <by role="visitor">Dr BRAYLEY:</by>  Yes, certainly. Currently, the service is providing advice and consultation, but it will be offering a range of services—a hub-and-spoke type of model—so training, research, early brief psychological therapies, working in partnership with people in local health networks, individual group programs, and then people with high needs or people who have complex needs would be receiving services directly from the BPD Co clinic, which is on Greenhill Road.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000633">Currently, the advice and consultation services have been operating. We are booked to do a gazettal inspection. We understand that they are going to be ready for a gazettal inspection on 2 August and then, after that, the full range of services will be provided by BPD Co.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for her question. As part of our commitment to reducing alcohol and other drug harms, the state government continues to work collaboratively with our commonwealth colleagues and with states and territories to address and reduce supply, demand and harms under the National Drug Strategy 2017-2026 and its substrategies. Our strong partnership with our federal colleagues continues to pay dividends for all South Australians and demonstrates the benefits of a positive and respectful relationship with Canberra.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000678">I particularly welcome the commonwealth government's $20 million investment in South Australian alcohol and other drugs sectors as part of the South Australian alcohol and other drug treatment grant opportunity. This funding is for 2018-19 to 2020, to support substance misuse treatment services in South Australia. In addition, the federal Minister for Health, the Hon. Greg Hunt, has announced a further $3 million in funding for alcohol and other drug treatment services in the South-East region of South Australia. South Australia is also one of only three jurisdictions to be included in the commonwealth's take-home Naloxone project pilot.</text>

The Aboriginal Drug and Alcohol Council has received funding for a set of outreach services and diversionary activities in Ceduna region, and the Aboriginal Health Council of South Australia has received funding for alcohol and other drugs sector, workforce development and capacity building across many regions of the state.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000681">Baptist Care has received funding for a residential rehabilitation program for young people from across the state to access. Country and Outback Health Incorporated has received funding for outreach services, counselling and case management for the Mid North and Peterborough region. Mission Australia has received funding for a youth-focused case management, prevention and early intervention pilot for the Fleurieu Peninsula region, Murray Bridge and also for the Playford council region.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000682">The Murray Mallee General Practice Network has received funding for counselling and case management in the Murray Bridge area. The South Australian Network of Drug and Alcohol Services has received funding for workforce development and capacity building for the training of the sector, again to support services across many regions of the state. Sonder has received funding from the Australian government for in-home withdrawal management for the Port Adelaide region and also for the Playford council region.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000683">I should add that Drug and Alcohol Services was also fortunate to receive some funding through this initiative. We have received funding to pilot an assertive outreach program, and we are currently negotiating with the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network and also the Flinders and Upper North Local Health Network to establish those assertive outreach programs.</text>

This is Budget Paper 4, Volume 3, page 24, targets. I refer to the establishment of a peer mental health workforce cooperative model and embedded guidelines for the peer mental health workforce and ask: is this the mental health priority care centre that is going to be located in the CBD that you announced with Senator Birmingham in May this year?</text>

          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000708">I thank the honourable member for highlighting the commonwealth government's commitment to invest $14.7 million to establish a mental health urgent care centre in the Adelaide CBD. It is our view that this will help ease pressure on our hospital systems, including the Royal Adelaide Hospital emergency department. The investment will mean that many people with mental health conditions will be able to get the services they need without going to an emergency department. It is our expectation that the centre would be operational next year.</text>

We have identified a preferred partner for the dementia village adjoining it. As I mentioned earlier, the outreach team will also be on the Repat Health Precinct. The work is continuing not just in relation to facilities, because I think we can often get overly focused on buildings and beds.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000738">With the work in relation to aged-care service reform, in the context of the needs of people with dementia, it is not just going to be Ward 18, it is not just going to be the specialised dementia care unit that will be placed on that site and in partnership with the commonwealth government, it will not just be the cottage-style dementia village that we will be delivering in partnership with a non-government provider. We are very much looking forward to the impact of the rapid access service, which will provide specialist in-reach support into mainstream residential aged care.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000739">One of the really important initiatives that the government has underway under this reform program is to work collaboratively with the aged-care sector to share innovation in continuing to provide high-quality person-centred care for people with dementia. There has been a lot of focus on the needs of people, in particular in tier 7, in terms of tier 7 behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. There has also been a lot of work done on tiers 5 and 6.</text>

We certainly are keen to build on the establishment of the 18-bed neurobehavioural unit at the Repat site and we will be looking at adding to that tier 7 bed stock as we are able.</text>

This government went to the election committing to do an audit of facilities that are not audited or accredited under the commonwealth residential aged-care facilities arrangements. Not only did we deliver on that commitment in government but we also broadened the scope of that audit to include an audit of facilities that are also audited by the commonwealth.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000818">We addressed a major gap in the quality assurance framework of the previous government and, if you like, took the opportunity to test the quality of our facilities that were already being accredited under the commonwealth regimes. We are determined that we will raise the standards in terms of aged-care quality and safety.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  Following an unannounced assessment visit on 7 November 2018, the Renmark Nursing Home received advice that they were two not met outcomes. An action plan was developed and a revised plan for continuous improvement was submitted to the Australian government compliance centre. On 8 February 2019, the commission determined that all improvements had been completed and no further action was required.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000829">In relation to the Ira Parker Nursing Home at Balaklava, the nursing home was issued with a notice on 21 February 2019. On 20 March 2019, the nursing home received advice that it had 19 not met outcomes and a sanctions notice was issued for a period of six months. Immediate corrective actions were undertaken, including the appointment of an administrator and a nurse adviser and regular meetings with the Australian government compliance branch. The Ira Parker Nursing Home received the commission audit report on 11 June 2019. The report noted that the initial 19 not met outcomes had now been met in terms of requirements under the standards.</text>

          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000830">This report requires review by the compliance branch and they will confirm the next steps for the Yorke and Northern Local Health Network. A meeting with the compliance branch was held on 24 June. Following the meeting, the compliance branch informally advised the Yorke and Northern Local Health Network that they can now apply for the sanctions to be lifted. The Yorke and Northern Local Health Network will now undertake this work.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000831">In relation to Melaleuca Court, on 28 and 29 May 2019 the commission conducted a site visit. The audit report was received on 5 June and two not met outcomes were identified. The report highlighted two recommendations that required a response from Yorke and Northern Local Health Network. In relation to the Loxton nursing home, it underwent a full accreditation audit on 6 May to 8 May 2019. The audit reported noted six outcomes not met. The audit report is available on the website.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000832">The site provided a response to the audit report. A decision was received on 13 June 2019, with the outcome being re-accreditation for two years until July 2022; however, the site has a timetable for improvement until 9 September 2019 to ensure that all 44 outcomes are fully met. The site currently meets 38 of 44 outcomes and a review will occur in September.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000833">In relation to the Riverton aged-care facility, an unannounced visit was undertaken by the commission on 15 May 2019. The audit report highlighted one not met standard. The report is not yet publicly available. The commission determines when reports are published. The site provided a response to the audit report, and the commission referred the audit report to the aged-care compliance centre within the department for risk assessment and action. The compliance centre conducted a risk assessment and found that the risk to care recipients at the service was low, as the evidence from the commission did not identify current risk to care recipients and Riverton had commenced a comprehensive review in order to create a plan to address the noncompliance that mitigated any potential risk to care recipients.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000834">In relation to Bonney Lodge Hostel at Barmera, it underwent a full accreditation visit from 25 to 28 June 2019. The report highlighted 21 not met outcomes. The facility has until 1 August 2019 to provide a full response for each outcome to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. Hawdon House nursing home, which is also at Barmera, which I understand is co-located, underwent a full accreditation visit on 25 to 28 June 2019, and that audit report also highlighted 21 not met outcomes; likewise, that facility has until 1 August to provide a full response to the commission.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I have discussed these issues with the Attorney-General. It is my understanding that a licence is not required to sell liquor at a retirement village by the committee association or operator. The intention of the liquor licensing laws is to regulate the location of the sale and consumption of liquor and to ensure that liquor is not sold to or by minors. A residents' committee, the operator or a resident can sell liquor within the village without requiring a licence.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000860">I am advised that residents' committees will be able to operate the bar and run events in their villages going forward. I am advised that Lifestyle SA is currently working on operational guidelines for functions in the villages, including the sale of alcohol, where any profits are to be used for the benefit of the residents of the village. In the meantime, it is business as usual, with residents' committees continuing to operate the bar and hold functions.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  I thank the honourable member for her question. Creating an age-friendly South Australia is a critical element to ensure that older South Australians feel valued and can participate in all aspects of life, including into old age. The government is committed to supporting South Australians to age well and identify opportunities to combat ageism, including challenging the way that ageing is framed in the language and structure of the services our government delivers.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000866">We want to ensure that government customer service settings provide a quality customer experience for older South Australians. I am very pleased that in 2018-19 the government, through the Office for Ageing Well, allocated $15,000 to deliver the age-friendly customer services rollout project across South Australian government customer service settings. I will ask Ms Walters to provide more information about this important project.</text>

            <by role="visitor">Ms WALTERS:</by>  The age-friendly customer services rollout project aims to improve the customer experiences of older people who access a range of government services, supporting older people to feel valued, listened to and respected when accessing government services. To develop the project the Office for Ageing Well worked with a group of seven older volunteer age-friendly advisors and staff from a range of customer-facing areas across the South Australian government on an age-friendly customer services pilot project in 2018. This has informed the larger scale rollout project.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000868">The age-friendly advisors discussed their own experiences when accessing government services, as well as the experiences of their peers, and described their age-friendly customer service ideals. They told us they want government services that respond to the diversity of their needs and interests, are easily accessible, treat them with dignity and respect, encourage their participation in service design and review, and are supported to be age-friendly.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000869">The Office for Ageing Well used these priorities and the South Australian Charter of the Rights and Freedoms of Older People to develop and test a suite of age-friendly customer service guidelines and resources. To ensure their relevance across a range of customer service settings, key South Australian government stakeholders helped co-design and test the guidelines and resources, including within SA Health in the Royal Adelaide Safety and Quality Unit, the Central Adelaide Aged Care Assessment Team, the Office for Ageing Well, the South Australia Police, the Public Library Network, Service SA, Housing SA in the Adelaide and Marion offices, the Women's Information Service, the Public Trustee, and the Justice of the Peace service.</text>

            <by role="member" id="3164">The Hon. S.G. WADE:</by>  Yes, indeed there have been. I should say that we want to acknowledge the commonwealth investment in home care packages. Earlier this year, a commitment to another 20,000 home care packages was made by the commonwealth. However, I am concerned that the data indicates that older South Australians are not getting an equitable share of the available home care packages.</text>
          <text id="20190726c6bc5f78748c420980000874">South Australia has 8 per cent of Australia's population aged over 65 yet only 6.4 per cent of new home care entries were South Australian. This is a reduction from 7.7 per cent in 2018. One of our concerns is that South Australia may be suffering because of our attempt to respect the commonwealth performance expectations on Aged Care Assessment Teams. Because of my concerns I have written to my federal colleague on that issue.</text>
