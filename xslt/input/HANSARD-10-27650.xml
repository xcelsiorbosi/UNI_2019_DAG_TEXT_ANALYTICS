BOURKE (14:42):</by>  Given the minister yesterday had to make a personal explanation that her share portfolio was incorrectly listed, and you are still yet to update that, despite coming into parliament and apologising, how are South Australians meant to have any confidence in your credibility?</text>

I have corrected the record. That is, I think, what the expectation is, that if an error is discovered you correct it.
