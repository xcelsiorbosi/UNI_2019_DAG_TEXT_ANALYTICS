Ridgway: But you told us before you never read reports. The Hon. R.I. LUCAS (Treasurer) (15:26): Mr President, I won't go down that particular path, as delicious as that interjection might have been in relation to the Hon. Mr Wortley saying he couldn't trust himself to read his own reports. I don't know why the Hon. Mr Wortley was unable to get a copy of the royal commission report. It was certainly publicly available. If it pleases the member, I will see whether there is not a spare copy somewhere. If we do find a spare copy and give it to him, I will be asking questions afterwards of the honourable member just to make sure he did read it. The Hon. D.W. Ridgway: Do you want it delivered to Scuzzi or something more convenient for you? The PRESIDENT: Are you finished, the Hon. Mr Ridgway? The Hon. R.P. WORTLEY: You just worry about our trade exports, mate, for the state. The PRESIDENT: The Hon. Mr Wortley, I am waiting patiently here to give you the call for your question.

       "\"Bills. Statutes Amendment (Heavy Vehicles Registration Fees) Bill. Second Reading. Adjourned debate on second reading.. (Continued from 1 June 2017.). The Hon. J.M.A. LENSINK (16:35):  I rise to indicate opposition support for this bill, which is part of the harmonisation of national laws which relate to heavy vehicles. In particular, this bill amends the Highways Act and the Motor Vehicles Act so that South Australia can meet its obligations under the Heavy Vehicle National Law (South Australia) Act 2013, which contains the national law as a schedule. This bill provides for the creation of a national heavy vehicle regulator. For the benefit of readers, heavy vehicles are defined as trucks with a gross vehicle mass of 4.5 tonnes or more.. The section relating to registration of the national law has not commenced yet, so heavy vehicle registrations remain under state legislation; however, those jurisdictions which are participants, which I understand includes all states and territories except for the Northern Territory and WA, are governed by model law approved by the national Transport and Infrastructure Council, made up of state and territory ministers. Vehicle registration charges are currently calculated on the basis of road user charge and regulatory charge components.. Participating jurisdictions have agreed that the revenue which is collected will be transferred to the regulator to undertake its duties. Amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act clarify that deductions from concessional registration charges for people living in remote areas and from primary producers will be taken from the roads component rather than the regulatory component of the fees provided to the regulator's fund.. This bill is, in effect, a stopgap to cover arrangements until the other arrangements are completed. I am advised that registration fees will not increase, but a portion will be provided to the NHVR instead of going to the Highways Fund. With those comments, I commend the bill to the house.. Debate adjourned on motion of Hon. J.E. Hanson.\""
