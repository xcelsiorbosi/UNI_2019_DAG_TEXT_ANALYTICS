# Hansard Data Mining Project

The Hansard Data Mining Project is a University project (Semester 2 2019) being completed at the University of South Australia with the [Auditor-General's Department](https://www.audit.sa.gov.au/) (AGD). The objective of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept dashboard for AGD to analyse unstructured text data sources, focusing on Hansard records from South Australian Parliament. [Hansard](http://hansardpublic.parliament.sa.gov.au/#/search/0) is the complete record of Parliamentary debates and questions. The dashboard would allow AGD staff to better interrogate and summarise discussions in Hansard to identify relevant information for audits. It would ingest Hansard extracts from Parliament's website and provide a dashboard for auditors to review

This project contains Python code to scrape the data from [Hansard](http://hansardpublic.parliament.sa.gov.au/#/search/0), process this data, and store the data in SQL Server.
