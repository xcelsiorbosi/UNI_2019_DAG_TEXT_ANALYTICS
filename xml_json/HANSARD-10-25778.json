However, findings from Professor Gemmell's independent review of UCG commissioned by the Scottish government, were considered in the state government's assessment of the Leigh Creek Energy demonstration project. In his review, Professor Gemmel concludes that establishing credible baselines, firm planning and licensing conditions and subsequently enforcing robust regulatory, monitoring and liability management arrangements would be paramount to the realisation of any successful UCG project. It is exactly for these reasons that in South Australia through the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000, licensees are required to undertake sufficient exploration, appraisal and site assessments to enable informed evidence- and fact-based regulatory decisions on any UCG proposal in this state. Further details are provided in the assessment summary report for the Leigh Creek Energy demonstration project, available on the Department for Energy and Mining website."}, {"@id": "20190212131802292dde4cd7a0000012", "inserted": "Website link:"}, {"@id": "20190212131802292dde4cd7a0000013", "item": {"@sublevel": "2", "inserted": "http://energymining.sa.gov.au/petroleum/projects/prj_leigh_creek_energy_isg."}}]}]}}}}
